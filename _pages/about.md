Hey there!

I'm a student from Switzerland with a strong passion for NLP, sociolinguistics, and using language models to identify hate speech. In my free time, I also tinker with modding video games.

I'm in the middle of my Master's Degree in Digital Linguistics at the University of Zurich and aim to finish in 2023. For now, I hope to be able to contribute my skills and knowledge in an internship or other industry position.
